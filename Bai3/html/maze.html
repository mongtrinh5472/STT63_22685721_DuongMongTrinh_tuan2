                        <p>
                            Welcome to the Sunny Arces Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from agricultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe, mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes in Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one of our own right outside of Council Bluffs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
